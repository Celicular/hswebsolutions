# HS Web Solutions - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
HS Web Solutions is a professional web development services company, offering website and application development with a focus on quality, security, and client satisfaction. The website showcases the company's services through an engaging, animated interface built with Next.js and Framer Motion.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (v15.3.0)
- **UI Libraries**: 
  - Framer Motion (v12.7.4) for animations
  - GSAP (v3.12.7) for advanced animations
  - React Icons (v5.5.0) for iconography
  - Swiper (v11.2.6) for carousels/sliders
  - React Intersection Observer (v9.16.0) for scroll-triggered animations
- **Database**: MySQL (mysql2 v3.14.0 package)
- **Optimization**: Dynamic imports, code splitting, and lazy loading with Suspense

## Animation System

### Animation Architecture
The project originally implemented a centralized animation system with the following components, which have now been refactored:

1. **ScrollAnimations.js** - A utility file containing predefined animation variants for various components
2. **AnimationController.js** - A global controller that managed animation states across the site
3. **Custom Animation Hooks** - For implementing scroll-triggered animations
4. **AnimatedLayout.js** - A wrapper component for page transitions
5. **ClientLayout.js** - A client-side layout component that addressed Next.js metadata export issues

### Current Animation Implementation

The project now uses a component-based animation approach where each component:

1. Uses Framer Motion and React Intersection Observer to detect when elements enter viewport
2. Defines its own animation variants internally for better encapsulation
3. Implements performance optimizations like disabling animations on mobile devices
4. Uses controlled animations with `useAnimation` from Framer Motion to trigger sequences

### Animation Techniques

#### 3D Card Effects
- Implemented in `KeyFeatures.js` and `Industries.js` components
- Uses CSS variables for custom color theming
- Applies sophisticated hover animations with depth perception
- Creates glow effects using box-shadow and pseudo-elements

#### Text Reveal Animations
- Split text animations for headings with character-by-character reveal
- Staggered animations for list items and paragraphs
- Uses custom easing functions for natural movement

#### Scroll-Triggered Animations
- Components animate when they enter the viewport using `useInView` hook
- Threshold control to trigger animations at specific scroll positions
- Once-only animations to prevent repetition when scrolling back and forth

#### Background Motion Effects
- Floating UI elements with continuous motion using infinite loop animations
- Parallax effects on scroll for depth
- Interactive mousemove-based animations in the AnimatedBackground component

#### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced animation complexity on mobile devices
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth counters (in StatsCounter)
- Implemented conditional rendering for heavy animation components

### 2. Framer Motion Compatibility
- **Issue**: "motion is not defined" and "positionalValues[name] is not a function" errors
- **Solution**:
  - Updated import statements for Framer Motion
  - Modified text animation functions to handle unit conversion properly
  - Implemented error boundary components for animation failures
  - Added conditional rendering for problematic components

### 3. Animation Performance
- **Issue**: Performance degradation on mobile devices
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented device detection for reducing animation complexity
